# Changelog

This file starts at the relicensing; earlier history is in the git tags and GitHub releases.

## Unreleased

- Relicensed from PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 to Apache-2.0. All releases up to and including v0.9.5 remain under PolyForm-NC; this tag onward is Apache-2.0.
- Native Wayland support on Linux. The GLFW Wayland backend is now built whenever its dev packages are present (`NETVIS_GLFW_WAYLAND=AUTO`, the new default) and is always built for release packages; the X11 backend stays in the same binary as a fallback. `NETVIS_PLATFORM=x11|wayland` forces a backend at runtime. A `netvis.desktop` entry is installed so Wayland compositors show the app icon, and GLFW errors are now reported on stderr instead of the app exiting silently.
