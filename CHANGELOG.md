# Changelog

This file starts at the relicensing; earlier history is in the git tags and GitHub releases.

## Unreleased

- Relicensed from PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 to Apache-2.0. All releases up to and including v0.9.5 remain under PolyForm-NC; this tag onward is Apache-2.0.
- **Fixed: CoreML `.mlmodel` files failed to open** (#114). v0.9.5 added a TensorFlow
  structural sniff ahead of the `.mlmodel` extension guard in format detection. A
  CoreML `Model` protobuf satisfies that sniff exactly — field 1 varint, field 2
  length-delimited, whose own first field is length-delimited — so ordinary
  `.mlmodel` files were handed to the TensorFlow parser and died with "SavedModel
  meta_graph carries no graph_def".
- Added [`docs/format-support.md`](docs/format-support.md): what every supported
  format yields (graph, shapes, addressable weights) and the known gaps per format.
  `tests/test_format_matrix.cpp` re-derives the table from the shipped fixtures on
  every test run, so a support claim cannot go stale unnoticed.
