# Changelog

This file starts at the relicensing; earlier history is in the git tags and GitHub releases.

## Unreleased

- **Changed default: the scroll wheel now pans the graph instead of zooming (#158).** The canvas now follows Netron: scrolling, or a two-finger swipe on a trackpad, pans up/down and left/right, and Shift+scroll pans sideways with a mouse. Ctrl+scroll zooms at the pointer (Cmd+scroll or Control+scroll on macOS). On macOS the app also reads trackpad pinch (zoom) and precise scroll deltas (1:1 finger tracking) through a small native bridge; that bridge has not yet been tried on real trackpad hardware, so treat both as expected rather than confirmed. Dragging with the left mouse button anywhere on the canvas pans (middle-drag and Space+drag still work). A node is now selected when you release a click, so starting a drag on a node no longer selects it. New keyboard zoom: Shift+Up / Shift+Down zoom in and out about the centre of the view, Shift+Backspace returns to 100% (Ctrl+= / Ctrl+- / Ctrl+0 also work, Cmd on macOS), and the arrow keys pan. **To get the old scroll-to-zoom back, choose View > Scroll wheel > Zoom** (also in Preferences and the command palette). The choice is remembered. Anyone who has used NetVis before (a saved preferences file, recent files, a saved session or a cached layout) sees a one-time notice on the first launch after upgrading; a fresh install does not. Two differences from Netron are deliberate: Shift+scroll pans sideways rather than zooming, and Cmd+scroll zooms on macOS. See `docs/canvas-controls.md`.
- The shortcut reference no longer claims Ctrl means the Control key on macOS: Dear ImGui maps Ctrl shortcuts to Cmd there.
- Relicensed from PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 to Apache-2.0. All releases up to and including v0.9.5 remain under PolyForm-NC; this tag onward is Apache-2.0.
- Native Wayland support on Linux. The GLFW Wayland backend is now built whenever its dev packages are present (`NETVIS_GLFW_WAYLAND=AUTO`, the new default) and is always built for release packages; the X11 backend stays in the same binary as a fallback. `NETVIS_PLATFORM=x11|wayland` forces a backend at runtime. A `netvis.desktop` entry is installed so Wayland compositors show the app icon, and GLFW errors are now reported on stderr instead of the app exiting silently.
- MXFP4 and NVFP4 support. GGUF `MXFP4` (ggml type 39) and `NVFP4` (type 40) tensors are recognised, labelled by name, and decodable in the weight inspector's one-block preview (the preview now shows up to 64 values, the NVFP4 block size). SafeTensors `F4`/`F8_E8M0`/`F8_E4M3`/…, ONNX `FLOAT4E2M1`/`FLOAT8E8M0`/`FLOAT8E4M3FN`/…, and PyTorch `float4_e2m1fn_x2`/`float8_*` tensors (saved via `_rebuild_tensor_v3`, which torch uses for these dtypes) now show their exact element type instead of `?`.
- **Fixed: the Windows installer could not modify PATH on a machine with a long PATH** (#149). CPack's stock NSIS
  template reads PATH into a 1024-character NSIS string, so on any machine with a
  longer PATH it aborted with "Warning! PATH too long installer unable to modify
  PATH!". The template also skips the edit silently when it cannot see the install
  directory (a suspected cause of the "virtual drive" report, not a confirmed one).
  The edit now goes through `packaging/windows/netvis-path.ps1`, which has no length
  limit, preserves a `REG_EXPAND_SZ` PATH's unexpanded `%VARS%`, and touches only
  NetVis's own entry (an uninstall with nothing to remove writes nothing). The
  "Do not add / all users / current user" choice is now honoured even when "Do not
  create shortcuts" is ticked. A failed edit is non-fatal: the install completes,
  the template's own PATH edit gets a turn, and the installer names the folder to
  add by hand. Not fixed: a drive-letter install that fails outright on a virtual
  or mapped drive; that needs its own repro (#149 stays open).
- **Fixed: CoreML `.mlmodel` files failed to open** (#114). v0.9.5 added a TensorFlow
  structural sniff ahead of the `.mlmodel` extension guard in format detection. A
  CoreML `Model` protobuf satisfies that sniff exactly — field 1 varint, field 2
  length-delimited, whose own first field is length-delimited — so ordinary
  `.mlmodel` files were handed to the TensorFlow parser and died with "SavedModel
  meta_graph carries no graph_def". The extension guard now runs first, and CoreML is
  also recognised from content (its model type sits at a field number of 200 or
  more, which no TensorFlow or ONNX protobuf uses), so a CoreML file renamed without
  the `.mlmodel` suffix no longer falls through to TensorFlow or ONNX.
- Format detection: length checks in the protobuf sniffs are now overflow-safe. A
  hostile length varint near 2^64 could wrap the bounds check and be accepted.
- Added [`docs/format-support.md`](docs/format-support.md): what every supported
  format yields (graph, shapes, addressable weights) and the known gaps per format.
  `tests/test_format_matrix.cpp` re-derives the table from the shipped fixtures on
  every test run, so a stale row cannot go unnoticed. Only the table is checked, not
  the prose around it, and the cost and shape-inference code has not yet been audited
  for fabricated values (still open under #114).
- CI builds the GUI app and runs `ctest` on Linux (both the `ubuntu-22.04` release image and `ubuntu-latest`), macOS and Windows for every pull request and push to master (#169), so a platform break shows up on the PR instead of when a release tag is built. The test suite was made portable to MSVC with test-only changes; no library or app behaviour changes.
- Added a `.gitattributes` rule (`CHANGELOG.md merge=union`, #169) so the append-only changelog merges without conflicts when two branches each add entries; check the merged text afterwards, since a union merge keeps both sides' lines as they are.
